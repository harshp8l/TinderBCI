### Procedure
* Continually recorded data of the different metrics provided by the NeuroSky headset. When it was time to make a decision (i.e. right swipe vs. left swipe) the last 3 seconds of data was used to calculate the average and standard deviation of these different metrics and was paired with the appropriate decision (left vs. right)
